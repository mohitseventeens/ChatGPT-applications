# ChatGPT Prompt Engineering
This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates best practices for prompt engineering with ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI.

The notebook shows how to use the LLM APIs to perform a variety of natural language processing tasks, including summarizing text, inferring sentiment and topics, transforming text, and expanding text.

In addition to practical examples, the notebook introduces two key principles for writing effective prompts and shows how to systematically engineer good prompts. It also provides a step-by-step guide to building a custom chatbot.
