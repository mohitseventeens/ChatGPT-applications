# ChatGPT-applications
The ChatGPT Applications repository is a collection of projects and applications that showcase the potential of the ChatGPT language model.
ChatGPT is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI that can understand and generate human-like text. The repository contains projects that use ChatGPT to create useful and interesting applications.

## Projects:
1. Image Classification Model: In this project we'll create an Image Classification Model using ChatGPT. We'll build a Neural Network with MNIST using Keras. 
2. Using ChatGPT API: This project demonstrates how to use the ChatGPT API to generate text. It includes a simple application that takes user input and generates a response using ChatGPT.

Each project is contained in its own directory, with its own README file that explains the application. You can also explore the code and make modifications to suit your needs.
