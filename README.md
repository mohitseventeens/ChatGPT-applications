# ChatGPT-applications
The ChatGPT Applications repository is a collection of projects and applications that showcase the potential of the ChatGPT language model.
ChatGPT is an advanced language model developed by OpenAI that can understand and generate human-like text. The repository contains projects that use ChatGPT to create useful and interesting applications.

## Projects:
1. Image Classification Model: In this project we'll create an Image Classification Model using ChatGPT. We'll build a Neural Network with MNIST using Keras. 
2. ChatGPT Prompt Engineering: This project contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates best practices for prompt engineering with ChatGPT, a large language model trained by OpenAI. This project also demonstrates how to use the ChatGPT API to generate text.
3. (...to be done later)

Each project is contained in its own directory, with its own README file that explains the application. You can also explore the code and make modifications to suit your needs.
